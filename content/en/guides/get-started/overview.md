## What is DNS Driveby?
DNS Driveby is a name I coined for a [wardriving](https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/wardriving) technique that uses Open WiFi networks for telemetry. 

Wardriving is one of my favorite ways to gather quick & easy wireless reconnaissance, and this takes it a step further by taking advantage of insecure networks for applications like GPS tracking!

## Insecure Networks
According to [Kaspersky](), 1 in 4 WiFi networks is open / insecure, which I proved through multiple personal trials, with 18-23% Open WiFi networks per session.  We can take advantage of these insecure networks as a rudimentary way to send intermittent location updates or telemetry across the internet.
