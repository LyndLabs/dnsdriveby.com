The DNS Driveby is a cute, powerful DuckyScript‚Ñ¢ platform that features a screen, buttons, and Wi-Fi support for flexible payload deployment created by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/alexlynd\">Alex Lynd</a>.
<br/><br/>
Run and edit payloads over Wi-Fi from mobile and desktop devices, or use the quick-select menu to launch payloads at the press of a button. Watch each command execute in real time on the built-in screen, and get instant feedback on your attack from the built-in LED.
<br/><br/>
The DNS Driveby mounts as a USB flash drive when plugged into your computer, making it easy to drag and drop multiple payloads to the onboard storage.
